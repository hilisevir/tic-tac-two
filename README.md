# Tic-Tac-Two

Tic-Tac-Two is a university project written in C# that extends the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with additional mechanics. The game supports both console-based and web-based gameplay and includes a fully functional persistence layer for saving game states and configurations.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® **Cross-Platform Gameplay** â€“ Play in the console or in a web-based UI.
- ðŸ’¾ **Game State Persistence** â€“ Automatically saves game progress and settings.
- ðŸ›  **Pre-Configured Database** â€“ Migrations and database files are already included.
- ðŸ”„ **Fully Functional Data Layer** â€“ Built with SQLite and Entity Framework Core.
